          Nextool is a GTD-oriented task manager that automates your reviews and lets you plan ahead.

          <strong>Automatically review stalled tasks. </strong> A good task management system requires trust. When
          you add a task, Nextool's algorithm ensures that the task always has actionable next steps. That way, you
          can know for sure that you'll never forget an important task.
        </p>
        <p>
          The GTD workflow requires quick capturing of thoughts, clarifying next actions, and focusing on
          actionable tasks. In pen-and-paper GTD, you have to manually review your tasks to make sure they haven't
          stalled &ndash; with Nextool, the reviews are automated.
